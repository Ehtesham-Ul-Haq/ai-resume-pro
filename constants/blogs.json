      "Software & Tool Names: List specific software, programming languages, or tools you are proficient in, such as 'Salesforce', 'Python', or 'Tableau'.",
      "Quantifiable Achievements: Include metrics and numbers to back up your claims. For example, 'Increased sales by 15% in Q3.'",

      "The debate between a one-page and a two-page resume continues, but in 2024, the one-page format remains a powerful tool. In a world of short attention spans, a concise, impactful resume can be your most valuable asset.",
      "A single-page resume forces you to be selective and highlight only your most relevant accomplishments. It shows recruiters that you respect their time and that you can communicate effectively. It's a testament to your ability to prioritize and present information clearly.",
      "Remember, the goal isn't to cram every detail onto one page. The goal is to craft a compelling narrative that tells a recruiter why you are the perfect candidate for the job, without any filler. Our AI tools are designed to help you do just that."
